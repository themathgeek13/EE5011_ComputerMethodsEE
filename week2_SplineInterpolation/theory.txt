Consider the interior nodes of a uniformly spaced spline interpolation problem. All the rows have three entries that have constant entries. So each row looks like

A*y_{n-1} + B*y_n +C*y_{n+1} = f_n

This is nothing but an IIR filter, and its stability depends on A, B and C. For the spline case, show that the two poles are one inside the unit circle and the other outside. The system is unconditionally unstable whatever the starting values.

To prove this, start the problem with known values of y'_0 and y''_0 (for a known problem like sin(x)). Obtain y''_i and hence interpolate and obtain y(x). Show it is very unstable.

So why does spline integration work so well?
